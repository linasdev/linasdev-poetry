Done something to make things right.
Because now they&#x27;re not,
I wish my body could just rot.
</code></pre>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><pre><code>
The emptiness inside of me is filled,
But not with happiness, that guy was killed.
Rather, loneliness is now my essence.
I know it doesn&#x27;t make much sense.

Now all I am, just me alone,
Still sitting on my phone.
Not for reaching out or finding help,
But rather crying and destructuring myself.

I&#x27;m not sure how much longer I can last,
It never was this bad in my entire past.
I derived my life and got a negative,
The graph could be a bit more sensitive...

Sensitive to trying, to changing me,
I&#x27;m not the person I could be.
I guess my effort was a waste,
Just like a drug that has been laced.
