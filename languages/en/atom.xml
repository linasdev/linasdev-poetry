        <content type="html">&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;I&amp;#x27;m seeing memories of tuesday,
Although of one that&amp;#x27;s yet to come.
I&amp;#x27;m seeing glimpses of that one day,
That is kind of just a bum.
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&amp;quot;Are these real memories?&amp;quot; - you hear me ask.
&amp;quot;Can I see into the future?&amp;quot;
I can almost hear it, that tiny scream,
Just a combination of all of my past,
Regurgitated by my brain like a dream.

That all has faded now, and yet I feel it clearly.
The need that is within me.
To be a man, to be a human.

The need that has been flushed.
Flushed not because it&amp;#x27;s not fulfilled
But because the need to not fulfill it,
Is a need that is ignored.
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
I don&amp;#x27;t wanna live like this,
With or without the need,
So maybe I should kill myself,
Maybe the devil I should feed?

It is obvious what I should do
And yet so painfully obscure.
Away the thoughts I should just boo,
Because there is no simple cure.

But the more you think,
The less you know.
And all of this
Is just for show...

I can&amp;#x27;t believe I found you, love.
I&amp;#x27;m with you for the long run...
Our love is like a dove,
By flying, it frees just about anyone.

It frees us from our daily burdens.
In each of us, it grows some gardens
So none of us gets lost in hurting.
It gives us life, when fail do organs,
And gives us death, when time is over.

My love, my dear, my baby,
There is no resisting you...
It&amp;#x27;s like I&amp;#x27;m sick with rabies
But every symptom&amp;#x27;s positive.

Why believe in these superfluous religions?
Is love not for humans anymore?

Will likely just complete the mission?

Will each of us be our own species?
Isn&amp;#x27;t that a little crazy?
Will people start dividing by their feces?
Right now, the world just seems so hazy...

Is there a point to this majestic circus?
Or is it all done for a specific purpose?
A purpose of survival but then again, of death?
How can you survive after your neighbor&amp;#x27;s final breath?

Is there a way to fix ourselves?
To become better, greater creatures?
Or are we doomed to put each other&amp;#x27;s heads on shelves
Because we didn&amp;#x27;t like each other&amp;#x27;s features?

Blooming on a touch.

I want your hair to brush.

I want to be your man,
And you to be my woman.
I want to touch you day and night,
With you, I have a world to light.

Full of joy and our love.
Let&amp;#x27;s live in the basement
That can be seen from above.

I wanna smell every flower
Through your nose full of cuteness.
I wanna meet in the shower
On the days full of muteness.

Let&amp;#x27;s live in this moment
With each other, that&amp;#x27;s all.
Let&amp;#x27;s not dwell on comment

Enough of this anxiety, of this depression.
I wish to make you a confession:
Never have I ever felt this weird.
And it&amp;#x27;s exactly what I feared:
My emotions have been cleared.

Continuing is hard, but I guess I must,
&amp;#x27;Cause there&amp;#x27;s this feeling in my chest.
To live, I have to, I can&amp;#x27;t do it.
And so my identity has split.
This is all I can admit.

Commiting deads of murder to yourself,
Can put you on the naughty shelf.
According to religions, yes, of course,
To follow them is a mind polluting crash course.
But there&amp;#x27;s some truth, just can&amp;#x27;t be forced.

And after all, who cares, life is just for living.
To please yourself, turn your eyes to giving.
That&amp;#x27;s a way to find relief,
Or inside a brain to turn a brand new leaf.

I need to be able to learn from the best,
And, I think, I can fully accomplish the rest.
You know that the best is, of course, only you.
With you, I wish to see my life through.

Without end I enjoy our talks of confessions,
We don&amp;#x27;t really care for physical possessions,
Because truth between us fuels our obsessions.
We can deal with each other&amp;#x27;s truthful rejections.

My life is a mess and we both know it well,
My soul to the devil I&amp;#x27;m willing to sell
For a life with you without worries or sickness.
I would answer that deal with unthinkable quickness.

In Bojack Horseman, I&amp;#x27;m the horse.
I just keep ruining and ruining my life.
I just keep sharpening and sharpening that knife.

That knife will never cut me
But the want for it to do so grows.
I&amp;#x27;m on a killing spree
But all I&amp;#x27;m killing is the guy whose life blows.

It&amp;#x27;s getting bad again. It keeps getting bad again.
How could I mess up so much?
How else will my life touch?
Will I live again just through a clutch?

But maybe it&amp;#x27;s not? Maybe it never got better?
My life is like the function of a constant.
Rises never, falls never.
Acts like a cunt...

It&amp;#x27;s like my goal is at the top of the tree

Waiting until somebody builds me a tower.

&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
Then nobody comes and nobody helps me.
They try, they just don&amp;#x27;t...
At this point, just let me be.
If you think a book will help, it won&amp;#x27;t.

If you think I&amp;#x27;m functioning, I&amp;#x27;m not.
Yesterday I went to the shop,
Saw a pretty leaf and left it there to rot.
A tree for sure I couldn&amp;#x27;t chop,
But wait for it to chop itself - I can.

If you think I&amp;#x27;m living in luxury, I&amp;#x27;m not.
Even though I get payed thrice the minimum.
All I hope to do is tie a knot.
How luxurious, of course, is this curriculum.

If you think I&amp;#x27;m fat, ugly, stupid and misguided, I&amp;#x27;m not.
That&amp;#x27;s not the reason for my suffering.
I just smoke a lot of pot.
Now inside my brain a leaf is rustling.

The leaf I couldn&amp;#x27;t choose to kill,
The leaf on which I write my will.
How can you, tell me please,
Your own throat so tightly squeeze...

There is no need for words
Nor is there a capability.
The world is full of open doors
It&amp;#x27;s just that passing needs emotional stability.

Stability which I don&amp;#x27;t have
Or able even to conceive.
At this point, I&amp;#x27;m not even on a path.
How do I my past retrieve?

The concrete warms me by existing,
The sky saddens me by being there.
I even saw a deathly listing,
For those pussies who can&amp;#x27;t bear.

There are no words inside me
Nor is there a heart or lung.
My body, I&amp;#x27;ll just let it be,
Because suicide - nobody will fund.

Why do friends exist and what&amp;#x27;s their purpose?
Seems like no one can help anyway.
As if they saw a floating carcass
But all they did was let it stay.

When I haven&amp;#x27;t yet foreseen the outcome.

A decent human being - that I am.
My feelings never are a scam.
When trouble comes for me or others,
I act as if we were all brothers.

A decent human being - that I am.
And when I face my most serious exam
I hope I&amp;#x27;ll pass with decent grades
Because I don&amp;#x27;t throw out any baits.

I have a lot of space to grow
And my emotions barely I can show.
But that space is difficult to navigate,
Although, I feel I&amp;#x27;ll get there at this rate.

I have a lot of space to grow.
A boat of freedom I can row
Once the space is somewhat cleared.
At that point, I&amp;#x27;m still gonna be weird.
Weird but better in a way,
That&amp;#x27;s all that I can say today.

Can you turn my frown into a smile?
I wish in me you would just sleigh,
All my feelings for a while...

Can you make today just go away?
Can you make my garden bloom?
I wish you took me to a bay,
And left me there to doom...

Can you make today just go away?
Can you touch me where it&amp;#x27;s aching?
Deep inside I wish to pay
For all the faults that turned you shaking.

Can you make today just go away?
Can you tell me it&amp;#x27;s okay?
I wish you would just let me be,
So I can throw myself into the sea.

        <content type="html">&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;There&amp;#x27;s nothing as great as a being
Whose heart only sorrow is leaving.
Though rarely does pleasure he find,
To the beauty of misery, his eyes are not blind.
And although time he has plenty to ponder,
The truth is still dark due to sonder.
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
A dummy exists for the pleasures of rain,
But bother he finds facing troubles of pain.
So the proof of a man who is fit to exist,
In the valleys of glee will surely be missed.
And the mountains whose peaks with blood are displayed,
The truth you will find of a man who is frayed.

And only in thoughts of the ones that were loved
Or in dreams of those who were not,
The despair you will find that makes people be hugged
But also the cause of why issues are shrugged.
So beware of the power of sorrow,
As your mind can become undeniably hollow.

Why the possibility of help I doubt?
Well, sadly, there&amp;#x27;s nothing you can do.
Tomorrow I&amp;#x27;ll forget this and you will too.

There&amp;#x27;s a chance this isn&amp;#x27;t even true,
Even though, that&amp;#x27;s what I pursue.
It doesn&amp;#x27;t really matter in the end.
Anything is possible for time to bend.

Time is sometimes just a friend.
Forgiving your mistakes and fixing any trend.
Sometimes, time can bring you to your end.
And your life you can&amp;#x27;t extend.

And even though the flow of time persists,
We divide it into years and what within exists.
Too bad that our emotions are more endless,
Dividing them, now that&amp;#x27;s just senseless.

Of course, there&amp;#x27;s some that dare.
And those are falling from the air.
To know that must be sorrowful,
Better snuggle up in wool.

I&amp;#x27;m anxious you hate me
For wasting your time.
I think that&amp;#x27;s the key
To why I can&amp;#x27;t climb
This mountain of lime.

So, hey, how was your day?
Did your life get hit by a ray?
A ray of sunlight, a ray of joy...
Don&amp;#x27;t play with me like I&amp;#x27;m a toy.

How did I grow backward?
Into an ocean of self-hate.
Down instead of up.
I&amp;#x27;m dying at this rate.

Say something, anything at all.
And my dice I&amp;#x27;m gonna roll
To see if I&amp;#x27;m able to respond
To somehow try to bond.

The only thing I seek from you:
Permission for me to do
The last act of my life
Assisted by this beauty of a knife.

I can&amp;#x27;t take this anymore.
Now I&amp;#x27;m on the floor.
I&amp;#x27;m shouting on my knees:
Can I do it, please?

Dreaming &amp;#x27;bout being drenched in red,
I can&amp;#x27;t move, my limbs are numb.
To save me, nobody will come.

Before, I was just lonely,
But now, I want to feel alone.
I still remember fondly,
How my mind I used to own.

No more need for people,
Just jumping off the highest steeple.
This feeling of wanting to be by myself,
I wish I could put it on a stupid shelf.

Because without others, I&amp;#x27;m nothing.
I&amp;#x27;m a mirror that&amp;#x27;s bluffing.
Lying bout being a man.
Understand, I don&amp;#x27;t think you can.

The emptiness inside of me is filled,
But not with happiness, that guy was killed.
Rather, loneliness is now my essence.
I know it doesn&amp;#x27;t make much sense.

Now all I am, just me alone,
Still sitting on my phone.
Not for reaching out or finding help,
But rather crying and destructuring myself.

I&amp;#x27;m not sure how much longer I can last,
It never was this bad in my entire past.
I derived my life and got a negative,
The graph could be a bit more sensitive...

Sensitive to trying, to changing me,
I&amp;#x27;m not the person I could be.
I guess my effort was a waste,
Just like a drug that has been laced.

That you yourself drive far
But can&amp;#x27;t at all control.
And even tho you know the goal.
You just sit there numb,
Not moving either thumb.

Sometimes people join you
And change the destination too.
Don&amp;#x27;t worry though, they leave.
No doubt in that, don&amp;#x27;t be naive.

The friends you seek
Are the ones you keep.
Although not &amp;#x27;till all your days are past,
Compared to that, you&amp;#x27;ll lose them fast.

Imagine you&amp;#x27;re a flower,
Your friends are then the bees.
And yes, you should take a shower.
You&amp;#x27;re dowsed in tears down to your knees.

Has never been ideal.
But beneath the broken mirrors
The truth you can&amp;#x27;t conceal.

The truth of our friendship,
The one that&amp;#x27;s gone for good.
But could we take a tiny sip
For something new to cook.

Be it wine or beer,
Be it night or day,
Lets make things very clear,
Relationships are maluable just like clay.

So sure, lets meet, lets have a drink.
Forget the memories that left us dead.
And don&amp;#x27;t begin to think
If there is mould on our bread.

I wish it all could just turn back.
The way it was, the way I was.
When I was happy just because.

Monotony has overwhelmed me.
Too bad I can&amp;#x27;t just flee...
I have to deal with this somehow.
Not later but right now.

A solution doesn&amp;#x27;t show,
All I view is just a glow,
Of what could be
If you embraced me.

Another world you&amp;#x27;d show
For a broken soul to grow.
All wounds would start to heal
Oh if only you were real...

Reality has struck my brittle bones.
For inspiration no one gives out loans.
No point in anything I&amp;#x27;ve ever done.
So sad that I don&amp;#x27;t own a gun...

They live their lives pretending like they&#x27;re everything, ignoring others, and acting like gods.&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; How can they be so blind as to not understand the irony? Cats are different in one fundamental way - they don&#x27;t have egos. Just like a human who licked a magical piece of paper, a cat is one with the universe. There are no friends, nor are there enemies, everything is one infinitely beautiful combination of emotions. Mari craved for this life. She wouldn&#x27;t have to try to be good or understand how others are feeling, none of that is really necessary when everything is united. And that&#x27;s how I made the biggest mistake of my life. I gave everything up in order to be a cat, so I couldn&#x27;t hurt others. That sounds nice until you realize that you don&#x27;t have to try anymore. Everyone likes you and you like everyone, that&#x27;s just how it is when we&#x27;re all connected. Only when you lose something, do you realize how meaningful it really was. Without her ego, Mari finally understood that being human is about trying, not about always doing the right thing. They try to protect each other, to understand each other, to love each other, and to care for each other. Try. They try. Can you see it now? Their intentions are rarely negative, what they lack is understanding. People are not united, they are not one and so they also can&#x27;t feel each other&#x27;s feelings. As much as it is their curse, it&#x27;s also a blessing. If you can never mess up, what is the point of living? I want to go back, I want to be human again, I want to try...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

And once passed, that&amp;#x27;s it, you&amp;#x27;re done.
The mind comes gone and body numb.
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
The act you never thought to undertake,
The act that seemed so far.
Your body floating in a lake.
The hope of death is sticky just like tar.

Now every second you&amp;#x27;re alive,
You wish to take that sweet relieving dive.
No soul can understand,
No soul can ever lend a hand.

No point in getting up or working.
You&amp;#x27;re just a project of a demon lurking.
While anything is possible and doors are open,
The need for all of that was stolen.

A murderer you can escape from,
A government can get shut down.
But once the problem you become,
You can&amp;#x27;t escape, you must succumb.

But I&amp;#x27;m not sure we have a pit.
The little core of a relationship,
Not provided by an acid trip.

Happy birthday, dear friend,
How much time should I lend
Writing some bullshit for you?
Because I have to, and this ain&amp;#x27;t new.

I have to because I care
and I know that sounds lame.
I&amp;#x27;m still gonna take my share
Of given emotions, which I must claim.

I still am doing this for you,
Because otherwise, I would be blue.
No way could I survive
Without providing happiness to life.

I hope your day was happy,
Full of thrills and sappy.
If not, then may this poem,
Provide plenty of them.

One day, we might be closer,
Unless one of us comes with a dozer.
But till that day comes,
Please play some happy birthday drums.

They say they&amp;#x27;re sleeping, go to die.
A wall of great annoyance they&amp;#x27;re beyond.
Just say when you&amp;#x27;ll be awake, don&amp;#x27;t fucking lie.

We all have that person in our lives,
It seems they come in fucking hives.
And even tho they are the devil,
You know, you can&amp;#x27;t become a rebel.

When all hope of contact&amp;#x27;s lost
And your mind goes sliding like on frost,
You must remember this great poem,
Relax, they&amp;#x27;ll come back, you know them.

The place where all your bad thoughts lie.
Escape? there is none,
When life is close to being done.

&lt;span id=&quot;continue-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
Too bad there is no god,
An afterlife I could have bought.
And as my carcass rots,
Untie me from your conscious knots.

No need to cry or mourn,
A better human was just born.
He won&amp;#x27;t be sad or suicidal,
Hell, could even be an idol.

The world moves on, the people live.
Oh god, what I would give
To get this curse off me.
Outside my window I could see...

As ages pass and earth comes dead,
Not a penny would I bet,
That anyone recalls my name
And no one is to blame.
After all, your fate is just the same.
