```
A friend just told me a joke.
I smiled as if I'm mentally broke.
Didn't comprehend what he said.
Replied not to seem inbred.
```

```

A real connection I do lack.
I wish it all could just turn back.
The way it was, the way I was.
When I was happy just because.

Monotony has overwhelmed me.
Too bad I can't just flee...
I have to deal with this somehow.
Not later but right now.

A solution doesn't show,
All I view is just a glow,
Of what could be
If you embraced me.

Another world you'd show
For a broken soul to grow.
All wounds would start to heal
Oh if only you were real...

Reality has struck my brittle bones.
For inspiration no one gives out loans.
No point in anything I've ever done.
So sad that I don't own a gun...
```
