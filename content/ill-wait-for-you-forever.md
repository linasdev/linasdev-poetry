```
I'll wait for you forever
Because you give me meaning.
I'll wait for you forever,
Because it seems appealing.
```

```

I can't believe I found you, love.
I'm with you for the long run...
Our love is like a dove,
By flying, it frees just about anyone.

It frees us from our daily burdens.
In each of us, it grows some gardens
So none of us gets lost in hurting.
It gives us life, when fail do organs,
And gives us death, when time is over.

My love, my dear, my baby,
There is no resisting you...
It's like I'm sick with rabies
But every symptom's positive.
```
