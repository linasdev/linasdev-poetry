```
A perfect human being I am not
But neither are you or anyone else...
It's not hard for me to tie a knot
Or ring the celebration bells.

```

A perfect human being I am not
And one I'm not trying to become.
But I wanna be what people sought
When I haven't yet foreseen the outcome.

A decent human being - that I am.
My feelings never are a scam.
When trouble comes for me or others,
I act as if we were all brothers.

A decent human being - that I am.
And when I face my most serious exam
I hope I'll pass with decent grades
Because I don't throw out any baits.

I have a lot of space to grow
And my emotions barely I can show.
But that space is difficult to navigate,
Although, I feel I'll get there at this rate.

I have a lot of space to grow.
A boat of freedom I can row
Once the space is somewhat cleared.
At that point, I'm still gonna be weird.
Weird but better in a way,
That's all that I can say today.
```
