```
Why don't I reach out?
Why the possibility of help I doubt?
Well, sadly, there's nothing you can do.
Tomorrow I'll forget this and you will too.

```

There's a chance this isn't even true,
Even though, that's what I pursue.
It doesn't really matter in the end.
Anything is possible for time to bend.

Time is sometimes just a friend.
Forgiving your mistakes and fixing any trend.
Sometimes, time can bring you to your end.
And your life you can't extend.

And even though the flow of time persists,
We divide it into years and what within exists.
Too bad that our emotions are more endless,
Dividing them, now that's just senseless.

Of course, there's some that dare.
And those are falling from the air.
To know that must be sorrowful,
Better snuggle up in wool.
