```
From deep within you comes,
The need that has been flushed.
Flushed not because it's not fulfilled
But because the need to not fulfill it,
Is a need that is ignored.
```
<!-- more -->
```

I don't wanna live like this,
With or without the need,
So maybe I should kill myself,
Maybe the devil I should feed?

It is obvious what I should do
And yet so painfully obscure.
Away the thoughts I should just boo,
Because there is no simple cure.

But the more you think,
The less you know.
And all of this
Is just for show...
```
