Mari always struggled living amongst humans. They live their lives pretending like they're everything, ignoring others, and acting like gods.<!-- more --> How can they be so blind as to not understand the irony? Cats are different in one fundamental way - they don't have egos. Just like a human who licked a magical piece of paper, a cat is one with the universe. There are no friends, nor are there enemies, everything is one infinitely beautiful combination of emotions. Mari craved for this life. She wouldn't have to try to be good or understand how others are feeling, none of that is really necessary when everything is united. And that's how I made the biggest mistake of my life. I gave everything up in order to be a cat, so I couldn't hurt others. That sounds nice until you realize that you don't have to try anymore. Everyone likes you and you like everyone, that's just how it is when we're all connected. Only when you lose something, do you realize how meaningful it really was. Without her ego, Mari finally understood that being human is about trying, not about always doing the right thing. They try to protect each other, to understand each other, to love each other, and to care for each other. Try. They try. Can you see it now? Their intentions are rarely negative, what they lack is understanding. People are not united, they are not one and so they also can't feel each other's feelings. As much as it is their curse, it's also a blessing. If you can never mess up, what is the point of living? I want to go back, I want to be human again, I want to try...
