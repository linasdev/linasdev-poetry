```
Today I made a wish to die.
I don't think that I can lie.
Both to myself and everyone around.
I'm down beneath the ground.
```
<!-- more -->
```

A casket I was put into
By society's homicidal hue.
And now beneath the ground
I'm wilting like a flower that was drowned.

The only thing I seek from you:
Permission for me to do
The last act of my life
Assisted by this beauty of a knife.

I can't take this anymore.
Now I'm on the floor.
I'm shouting on my knees:
Can I do it, please?
```
