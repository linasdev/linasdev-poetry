```
There is a point of no return.
Before it, your life starts to burn
And once passed, that's it, you're done.
The mind comes gone and body numb.
```
<!-- more -->
```

The act you never thought to undertake,
The act that seemed so far.
Your body floating in a lake.
The hope of death is sticky just like tar.

Now every second you're alive,
You wish to take that sweet relieving dive.
No soul can understand,
No soul can ever lend a hand.

No point in getting up or working.
You're just a project of a demon lurking.
While anything is possible and doors are open,
The need for all of that was stolen.

A murderer you can escape from,
A government can get shut down.
But once the problem you become,
You can't escape, you must succumb.
```
