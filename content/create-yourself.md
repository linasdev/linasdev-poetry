```
Create yourself
Because you are yourself.
If you don't, you'll end up in a cult
And no one ever begs for that result.

```

Why the sudden need for god?
Create yourself, don't be a fraud.
How come the universe is not enough?
You say it is, and yet it's really not that rough.

With all this beauty in the world,
Create yourself, be bold.
It doesn't matter if you get it wrong,
Because your stay you can't prolong.

No time for consequences after actions.
Beliefs are just distractions.
Hell, there won't be time at all
Or any friends for you to call.

Create yourself
Because you are yourself.
How can you be satisfied
From living by some other person's guide?
```
