```
Why crowd ourselves with stupid definitions?
Why believe in these superfluous religions?
Is love not for humans anymore?
Or human's love for subdivision
Will likely just complete the mission?
```
<!-- more -->
```

Will each of us be our own species?
Isn't that a little crazy?
Will people start dividing by their feces?
Right now, the world just seems so hazy...

Is there a point to this majestic circus?
Or is it all done for a specific purpose?
A purpose of survival but then again, of death?
How can you survive after your neighbor's final breath?

Is there a way to fix ourselves?
To become better, greater creatures?
Or are we doomed to put each other's heads on shelves
Because we didn't like each other's features?
```
