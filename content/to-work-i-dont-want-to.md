```
To work, I don't want to,
To sleep, I'm not able,
What the hell do I do,
When I don't have cable?
```
<!-- more -->
```

I wish I could just write you,
Without rhymes or meaning,
But that I can't do,
Because I'm a silly being.

I'm anxious you hate me
For wasting your time.
I think that's the key
To why I can't climb
This mountain of lime.

So, hey, how was your day?
Did your life get hit by a ray?
A ray of sunlight, a ray of joy...
Don't play with me like I'm a toy.

How did I grow backward?
Into an ocean of self-hate.
Down instead of up.
I'm dying at this rate.

Say something, anything at all.
And my dice I'm gonna roll
To see if I'm able to respond
To somehow try to bond.
```
