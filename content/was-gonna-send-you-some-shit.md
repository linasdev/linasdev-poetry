```
Was gonna send you some shit,
But I'm not sure we have a pit.
The little core of a relationship,
Not provided by an acid trip.
```

Happy birthday, dear friend,
How much time should I lend
Writing some bullshit for you?
Because I have to, and this ain't new.

I have to because I care
and I know that sounds lame.
I'm still gonna take my share
Of given emotions, which I must claim.

I still am doing this for you,
Because otherwise, I would be blue.
No way could I survive
Without providing happiness to life.

I hope your day was happy,
Full of thrills and sappy.
If not, then may this poem,
Provide plenty of them.

One day, we might be closer,
Unless one of us comes with a dozer.
But till that day comes,
Please play some happy birthday drums.
```
