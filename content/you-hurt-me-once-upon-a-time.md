```
You hurt me once upon a time,
But lets be real, I hurt you too.
The scars we proudly wear just shine.
Is it a dream to start anew?
```

```

The timing of our times together
Has never been ideal.
But beneath the broken mirrors
The truth you can't conceal.

The truth of our friendship,
The one that's gone for good.
But could we take a tiny sip
For something new to cook.

Be it wine or beer,
Be it night or day,
Lets make things very clear,
Relationships are maluable just like clay.

So sure, lets meet, lets have a drink.
Forget the memories that left us dead.
And don't begin to think
If there is mould on our bread.
```
