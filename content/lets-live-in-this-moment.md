```
Let's live in this moment
Without any worry or fear.
Let's do it more frequent.
It being everything dear.
```

```

I wanna see every sunrise
Through your eyes full of passion.
I wanna say to you all, excluding nothing but lies,
And not dwell into looks and/or fashion.

Let's live in this moment
Full of joy and our love.
Let's live in the basement
That can be seen from above.

I wanna smell every flower
Through your nose full of cuteness.
I wanna meet in the shower
On the days full of muteness.

Let's live in this moment
With each other, that's all.
Let's not dwell on comment
Of our peers in the hall.
```
