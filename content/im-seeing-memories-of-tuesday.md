```
I'm seeing memories of tuesday,
Although of one that's yet to come.
I'm seeing glimpses of that one day,
That is kind of just a bum.

```

"Are these real memories?" - you hear me ask.
"Can I see into the future?"
I can almost hear it, that tiny scream,
Just a combination of all of my past,
Regurgitated by my brain like a dream.

That all has faded now, and yet I feel it clearly.
The need that is within me.
To be a man, to be a human.
```
