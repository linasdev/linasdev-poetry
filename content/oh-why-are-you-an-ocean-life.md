```
Oh, why are you an ocean, life?
Just to laugh at my own internal strife?
We know what causes every ocean's tide,
But I can't figure out, what causes mine.

You're like a passenger in a car,
That you yourself drive far
But can't at all control.
And even tho you know the goal.
You just sit there numb,
Not moving either thumb.

Sometimes people join you
And change the destination too.
Don't worry though, they leave.
No doubt in that, don't be naive.

The friends you seek
Are the ones you keep.
Although not 'till all your days are past,
Compared to that, you'll lose them fast.

Imagine you're a flower,
Your friends are then the bees.
And yes, you should take a shower.
You're dowsed in tears down to your knees.
```
