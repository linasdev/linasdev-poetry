```
Your bed becomes the place you cry,
The place where all your bad thoughts lie.
Escape? there is none,
When life is close to being done.
```
<!-- more -->
```

Too bad there is no god,
An afterlife I could have bought.
And as my carcass rots,
Untie me from your conscious knots.

No need to cry or mourn,
A better human was just born.
He won't be sad or suicidal,
Hell, could even be an idol.

The world moves on, the people live.
Oh god, what I would give
To get this curse off me.
Outside my window I could see...

As ages pass and earth comes dead,
Not a penny would I bet,
That anyone recalls my name
And no one is to blame.
After all, your fate is just the same.
```
