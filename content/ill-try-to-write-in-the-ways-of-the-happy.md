```
I'll try to write in the ways of the happy,
You know, sometimes life is just crappy.
But I know what I need to be able to do,
That thing, my love, is to be more like you.
```
<!-- more -->
```

Your eyes glisten with love
When you're holding my hand.
You fly like a dove,
When you dance on the sand.

I need to be able to learn from the best,
And, I think, I can fully accomplish the rest.
You know that the best is, of course, only you.
With you, I wish to see my life through.

Without end I enjoy our talks of confessions,
We don't really care for physical possessions,
Because truth between us fuels our obsessions.
We can deal with each other's truthful rejections.

My life is a mess and we both know it well,
My soul to the devil I'm willing to sell
For a life with you without worries or sickness.
I would answer that deal with unthinkable quickness.
```
