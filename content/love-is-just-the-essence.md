```
Love is just the essence
Of a human coalescence.
I thought exist it did not
But now I wanna tie our knot.
```

```

Love is just a tool,
To make us humans drool.
Love is just a feeling,
To make us all believing.

Love is just a flower,
Blooming on a touch.
I want you in my shower,
I want your hair to brush.

I want to be your man,
And you to be my woman.
I want to touch you day and night,
With you, I have a world to light.
```
