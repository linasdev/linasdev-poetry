```
When dicks are dicks and don't respond,
They say they're sleeping, go to die.
A wall of great annoyance they're beyond.
Just say when you'll be awake, don't fucking lie.

```

We all have that person in our lives,
It seems they come in fucking hives.
And even tho they are the devil,
You know, you can't become a rebel.

When all hope of contact's lost
And your mind goes sliding like on frost,
You must remember this great poem,
Relax, they'll come back, you know them.
```
