```
Can you make today just go away?
Can you turn my frown into a smile?
I wish in me you would just sleigh,
All my feelings for a while...
```

```

Can you make today just go away?
Can you make my garden bloom?
I wish you took me to a bay,
And left me there to doom...

Can you make today just go away?
Can you touch me where it's aching?
Deep inside I wish to pay
For all the faults that turned you shaking.

Can you make today just go away?
Can you tell me it's okay?
I wish you would just let me be,
So I can throw myself into the sea.
```
