```
Normality you fucking bastard,
You cruel and subdividing bitch.
My life before was filled with custard,
Now I can't even scratch my social itch...
```
<!-- more -->
```

Normality, you're just a truth deception,
You're just a weird and unrealistic thing.
Oh please, just make me an exception...
So I can die but have my final swing.

Normality, just be my friend,
Why cannot I fully understand you?
When I think, that I have reached my end,
I double down because I don't know what to do.

Normality, please, disappear...
Just don't exist within myself or others.
Away from humans, you must steer,
So we can act as if we were all brothers.
```
