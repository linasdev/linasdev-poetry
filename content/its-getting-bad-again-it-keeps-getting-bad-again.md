```
It's getting bad again. It keeps getting bad again.
How could I do it back then?
Back when my tears were from joy
And my happiness was from a toy...
```
<!-- more -->
```

I can't keep doing this, just keep getting worse.
In Bojack Horseman, I'm the horse.
I just keep ruining and ruining my life.
I just keep sharpening and sharpening that knife.

That knife will never cut me
But the want for it to do so grows.
I'm on a killing spree
But all I'm killing is the guy whose life blows.

It's getting bad again. It keeps getting bad again.
How could I mess up so much?
How else will my life touch?
Will I live again just through a clutch?

But maybe it's not? Maybe it never got better?
My life is like the function of a constant.
Rises never, falls never.
Acts like a cunt...
```
