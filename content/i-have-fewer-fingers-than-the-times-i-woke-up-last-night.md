```
I have fewer fingers than the times I woke up last night,
Thinking, how to make wrong things right.
And no, I didn't find an answer,
Just grew my emotional cancer.
```
<!-- more -->
```

And now, laying in my bed,
Dreaming 'bout being drenched in red,
I can't move, my limbs are numb.
To save me, nobody will come.

Before, I was just lonely,
But now, I want to feel alone.
I still remember fondly,
How my mind I used to own.

No more need for people,
Just jumping off the highest steeple.
This feeling of wanting to be by myself,
I wish I could put it on a stupid shelf.

Because without others, I'm nothing.
I'm a mirror that's bluffing.
Lying bout being a man.
Understand, I don't think you can.
```
