Dreams, can they stay?
The wet concrete is touching my knee,
By the texture alone I am swept away.

<span id="continue-reading"></span><pre><code>
There is no need for words
Nor is there a capability.
The world is full of open doors
It&#x27;s just that passing needs emotional stability.

Stability which I don&#x27;t have
Or able even to conceive.
At this point, I&#x27;m not even on a path.
How do I my past retrieve?

The concrete warms me by existing,
The sky saddens me by being there.
I even saw a deathly listing,
For those pussies who can&#x27;t bear.

There are no words inside me
Nor is there a heart or lung.
My body, I&#x27;ll just let it be,
Because suicide - nobody will fund.

Why do friends exist and what&#x27;s their purpose?
Seems like no one can help anyway.
As if they saw a floating carcass
But all they did was let it stay.
